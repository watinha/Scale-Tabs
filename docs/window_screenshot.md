The window_screenshot module contains the base functions that grant the inclusion of the screenshot data in the base tab object of the Addon SDK.

This is done by adding a screenshot functionality on the open event for each tab. So as new tabs get openned, automatically new screenshots are taken and stored within them.

Additionally, this module also implements the tab-change functionality that is used in the main module.
