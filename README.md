--------- Scale tabs --------- 
This package enhances the browser with the Scale tabs functionality that assists you in organizing and interacting the the multiple tabs you are using. 

Scale tabs replaces the base BLANK tab that opens everytime you open a new tab with a tab selector mechanism. The mechanism lets you filter your tab accordingly to the keywords that compose it, and select the tab you wish for solely with keyboard interaction (using the arrow keys and the enter button). Each tab is visually represented by a screenshot of the current view of the tab, the title and a favicon icon.

If you wish to enter a new URL, just type CTRL+L or COMMAND+L to get back to the URL input of the browser. As new tabs are loaded, Scale tabs automatically extracts their screenshot and stores it persistently, in order to optimize your tab changing tasks.

How to use 
----------
1. Add a new tab (use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+L / COMMAND+L or click on the plus (+) button in the end of the tab bar of your browser).
2. Select the tab which you want to go to, using the keyboard arrows (pressing enter as you have selected the tab) or the mouse (clicking on the tab representation that you want to go).
3. Finally you will be presented with the tab you selected.

During the interaction you can press the ESC key or CTRL+W / COMMAND+W in order to get back to your previous tab.

During the interaction you can also press the CTRL+L or COMMAND+L shortcut to get back to your URL address input.

Future enhancements
